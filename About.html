<p>Hello, My name is Jose and I'm a College Student. I like long walk on the beach, listening to vocaloid music, playing video/bourd games, and writing programs. Although I am busy working on projects, studying materail, and keeping up with gaming content, there are those who had just began their journy in CSS and may need help. Although doing research and attending classes may help, I believe the best help is practical. So I have started a littile help session club.</p>
